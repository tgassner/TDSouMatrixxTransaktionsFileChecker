It scans for files that are older than a couple of hours and checks if they contain only binary null values.
You can select and delete suspicious files directly from the interface.
Please ensure you have the necessary permission to delete files in the target directory.
Always review the files before deletion to avoid accidental loss of important data.
There absolutely is no warranty, but you can use it as you want without mentioning the author.
